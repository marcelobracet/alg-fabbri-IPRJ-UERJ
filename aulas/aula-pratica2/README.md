## Continuing with AI 

### Ask it to write a function to sort vectors
- The vectors of unsigned char elements, but can be small or up to 1MB in size.
- The tests must include a benchmark of runtime
- Run and see the code
- Now write your own and test
- Verify that corner cases are tested, if not add them
